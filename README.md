# fig-ref
This is mostly a replacement for https://line-of-action.com/, with the following unique differences (I see them as improvements, YMMV):
* Use your own images (no images are provided for copyright reasons!  You must fill up the /img directory with your own images)
* Preview all images
* Drag and drop images (as a digital artist, the inability to do this on LOA drives me *crazy*, I need to have the reference image side by side on my canvas!)
* More granular session control
* No auto-start; you start the timer when you're ready

On the flip side, you have to run this yourself on a local PHP server, which makes it slightly less easy to use than a website. Of course, you could very easily make this into a website or throw it on a local server, do whatever you want :)
